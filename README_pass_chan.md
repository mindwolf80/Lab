Certainly. Here's a brief summary of what this script does:

This script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing password changes across multiple network devices. Here are its key features and functions:

1. CSV File Input: Users can select a CSV file containing network device information, including hostnames, current passwords, new passwords, and device types.

2. Password Change Functionality: The script can initiate a password change process for all devices listed in the CSV file. It uses threading to handle multiple devices concurrently.

3. Rollback Capability: There's a feature to rollback password changes, reverting to the original passwords if necessary.

4. Progress Monitoring: The GUI displays a progress bar and a log window, allowing users to track the status of password changes or rollbacks in real-time.

5. Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling and logging to help troubleshoot issues during the password change or rollback processes.

6. Device Type Support: It's designed to work with multiple types of network devices, including Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, and Arista EOS, with the ability to add more device types.

7. User Controls: Users can start, stop, and rollback operations via buttons in the GUI.

8. The script uses a dual-session approach for each device, maintaining a safety net connection during the password change process. It also includes a verification step, attempting to log in with the new password before finalizing the change.


Important notes:

- The CSV file should have a header row.

```

Example 1:
ip,dns,current_password,new_password,device_type
192.168.1.1,router1.example.com,oldpass123,newpass456,cisco_ios
10.0.0.1,switch1.example.com,currentpw789,updatedpw101,arista_eos

Example 2:
device_type,new_password,ip,dns,current_password
cisco_ios,newpass456,192.168.1.1,router1.example.com,oldpass123
arista_eos,updatedpw101,10.0.0.1,switch1.example.com,currentpw789
```

- Ensure there are no spaces after the commas.
- If any of your passwords contain commas, you'll need to enclose the password in quotes. For example:

```

192.168.1.1,"old,pass123","new,pass456",cisco_ios
```

Make sure the device types in the CSV exactly match the DeviceType enum values in the script. If you add new device types to the script, update your CSV accordingly.

This tool aims to simplify and secure the process of changing passwords across a network infrastructure, providing a user-friendly interface for network administrators to manage this critical task.
