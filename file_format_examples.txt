# Examples for each file type's expected format based on the provided requirements.
# These formats will ensure that your script can correctly read and execute commands for each device.


# TXT File Format

Each device starts with a `# Device Info:` line followed by commands for that device.

Example:

# Device Info: 192.168.1.1,Router1
ifconfig
ping -c 3 google.com
traceroute 8.8.8.8

# Device Info: 192.168.1.2,Router2
ifconfig
ping -c 3 yahoo.com
traceroute 8.8.4.4


# CSV File Format
# THE GENERATED FILES MUST BE FROM MS EXCEL OR ELSE IT GENERATES AN ERROR.
# THIS IS A PYTHON BUG BECAUSE OF THE WAY FILE TYPES ARE SAVED FROM 3RD PARTYY SOFTWARE LIKE SOFTWARE PLANNER.

Each row includes the IP address, DNS name, and a command for that device. Multiple rows are used for multiple commands per device.

Example:
ip,dns,command
192.168.1.1,Router1,ifconfig
192.168.1.1,Router1,ping -c 3 google.com
192.168.1.1,Router1,traceroute 8.8.8.8
192.168.1.2,Router2,ifconfig
192.168.1.2,Router2,ping -c 3 yahoo.com
192.168.1.2,Router2,traceroute 8.8.4.4


# XLSX File Format

An Excel file with three columns: IP, DNS, and Commands. Each device can have multiple rows for multiple commands.

Example:

| IP          | DNS     | Command          |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| 192.168.1.1 | Router1 | ifconfig            |
| 192.168.1.1 | Router1 | ping -c 3 google.com|
| 192.168.1.1 | Router1 | traceroute 8.8.8.8  |
| 192.168.1.2 | Router2 | ifconfig            |
| 192.168.1.2 | Router2 | ping -c 3 yahoo.com |
| 192.168.1.2 | Router2 | traceroute 8.8.4.4  |
